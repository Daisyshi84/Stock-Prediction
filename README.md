Abstract
In this project, I will use a machine learning model to predict the price of the stock that I am interested in. The model is designed to predict whether stock prices will rise or fall the next day, as well as the trends and to predict future prices based on historical data. At the same time, the risk characteristics and profitability of the stock are judged on the basis of analysis, and the corresponding trading strategy is made accordingly.
